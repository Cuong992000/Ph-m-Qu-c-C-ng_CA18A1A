Problem:
        Describe what happens when the programmer enters the string "Greetings!" in the Python shell.
Solution:
       When you enter an expression or statement, Python evaluates it and displays its result,
       if there is one, followed by a new prompt. The next few lines show the evaluation of several expressions and statements.

        Greetings!
