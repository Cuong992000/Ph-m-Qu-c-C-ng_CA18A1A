Problem:
          What does the central processing unit (CPU) do?
Solution:
         The part of a computer that is responsible for processing data is the central processing unit (CPU). This device,
         which is also sometimes called a processor, consists of electronic switches arranged to perform simple logical,
         arithmetic, and control operations. The CPU executes an algorithm by fetching its binary instructions from memory,
         decoding them, and executing them. Executing an instruction might involve fetching other binary information—the data—from memory as well.
