Problem:
    Assume that data refers to a list of numbers, and result refers to an empty list. Write a loop that adds the nonzero values in data to the result
    list, keeping them in their relative positions and excluding the zeros.
Solution:
Program Plan:
• Assume the data list of elements.
• Initialize the result list to empty.
• Use the for loop to iterate through each element in the list
• Check if the element is not 0
• If the element is not 0 then using append() method add to the end of the new list called result
