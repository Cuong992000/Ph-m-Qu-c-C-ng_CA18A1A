Problem:
    Explain the importance of the interface of a class of objects.
Solution:
• In Python, every data value is an object.
• An Object is nothing but the instance of a class.
• A class is a blueprint that an object should follow.
• A class contains characteristics and methods of a particular object.
• To better understand this analogy, let us consider an example of a human.
• A human can be considered as a class and his characteristics constitute his name, color, gender, age, and height.
• The abilities and actions that he can perform like jumping, working, playing can be considered as methods of a
particular human.
• Different humans having different characteristics and varying abilities can be considered as objects for the class
human.
• Python's type (data value) is the function that returns the class of given data value.
